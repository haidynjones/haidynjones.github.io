<h1>Country Swing Dancing</h1>

<h3>What is <dfn>Country Swing Dancing</dfn>?</h4>

<!--word that will be defined later on-->

    <p>According to the <i>Library of Dance</i>,
        <blockquote cite="https://www.libraryofdance.org/dances/country-swing/">"Country Swing is a popular American partner dance which combines rapid-fire Swing moves with awe-inspiring dips and lifts and the anything goes attitude of Blues."</blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>Swing dancing is usually done on crowded dance floors in western themed bars. Here in Idaho, there are three main country bars people can go to learn how to country swing or just social dance. </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Indian Creek Steakhouse</li>
        <li>The Buffalo Club</li>
        <li>Cowgirls</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Indian Creek Steakhouse is located in Caldwell, ID just off of the freeway in the Indian Creek Plaza. This is a great place for those who are under the age of 21 to go learn how to swing dance. Each Thursday at 7:30pm, a company called Dirt Road Dancing comes out to teach beginners how to swing dance. The Buffalo Club, located in Boise, as well as Cowgirls in Kuna, are more of a bar scene for those who are over the age of 21. At the Buffalo Club, Swing Dancing is taught by Country Dance Idaho, or
        <abbr title="Country Dance Idaho">CDID</abbr>, whereas Dirt Road Dancing teaches at Cowgirls in Kuna as well as Indian Creek Steakhouse.</p>

<h1>Why You Should Stop ‘Gamifying’ Your Health and Fitness</h1>
<h4>You don't need to chase a fake goal to be able to chase a real goal.</h4>

<p>By Beth Skwarecki</p>

<img width="850" height="550" src="fit.jpg">

<p>Whenever there’s a task you don’t want to do, there’s a guaranteed way to feel worse about it: Just add a whole layer of guilt and disappointment on top. Streaks that you’ll inevitably break, badges you don’t care about, check-in notifications that bug you when you were just trying to relax. Ahh, gamification.
</p>

<p>
Before we talk about all the reasons gamification is bullshit, let’s talk about why games work the way they do. In a roleplaying game, you earn “experience points” as a metaphor for real-life experience. You earn fake money because it’s meant to mimic the concept of real-life money. You’re given a quest because, in real life, people work hard in pursuit of goals. Games have these metrics and structures because the game is trying to imitate real life.
</p>

<h3>Aim for consistency, not streaks</h3>

<p>Streaks entertain you during good times with the explicit goal of heaping disappointment on you when you slip up. And they’re a particularly harmful type of misdirection, because people easily become more focused on the streak than on whatever reason they were doing the streak in the first place.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Running a local 5K, and trying to finish in the top X percent of your age group.</li>
    <li>Competing in something like a powerlifting meet, where you try to put up the best possible total on meet day.</li>
    <li>Joining a recreational sports league, and getting to know the members of your softball/soccer/pickleball team while either crushing the competition or commiserating about your inability to do so.</li>
</ul>

<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. <br>Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, <br> when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
