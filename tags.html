    Reflection
</h3>

<p class="reflection">
    The Squarespece assignment was a little more difficult for me. I felt like all of my pages had endless links to other pages due to the template I used. I think this could've been avoided if I had chosen a different template. Other than the links between pages, I think my site turbed out pretty well. It was also difficult to go from using the WordPress website maker and transition to Squarespace, as they are very different in how they work. Due to this difference, I feel like I was able to learn various ways of creating a website and how the platforms differ. one final thing that I would change if I had the opportunity to do this assignment again, would be to choose a different heading picture for all of the pages, besides the homme page. The photos were a little fuzzy, even thought that was what I wanted in the beginning. In the end, I am very proud of this site and think it could be used by the company I created it for (Country Dance Idaho), as I used real pricing and events on the site.

Each Thursday at 7:30pm, a company called Dirt Road Dancing comes out to teach beginners how to swing dance. The Buffalo Club, located in Boise, as well as Cowgirls in Kuna, are more of a bar scene for those who are over the age of 21. At the Buffalo Club, Swing Dancing is taught by Country Dance Idaho, or
